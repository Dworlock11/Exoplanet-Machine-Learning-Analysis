# Planet Habitability Prediction (WIP)

This is a work-in-progress project where I analyze planetary datasets
to predict potential habitability scores, among othert things, using machine learning techniques.

## Current Status
- Evaluation and visualization of logistic regression model (in progress).
- Repeat of model-building process for kNN (coming soon).

## Tools
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, Jupyter Notebook
