# Exoplanet Prediction and Analysis
This is a project where an exoplanet dataset is analyzed and 
machine learning models are created to predict exoplanet features and 
gain insights from them.

Classification models such as logistic regression are used to predict 
exoplanet type (for example, is it Jovian or Terran?) and regression
models are used to predict exoplanet mass. 

The most important features for predicting these characteristics
are determined and analyzed.

## Tools
Python (3.12.12), pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
